UserStories: 
- As a user I expect there to be a way for me to view the last mileage and date of previous fill-ups, 
	so I know the current miles on my vehicle.
 
- As a user I want there to be a quick way for me to add a new fill up to the log so I am able to
	keep track of my usage.

- As a user I would like the app to automatically update the mpg per fill-up, therefore I 
	know how well my car is doing.

	so I can keep a easy record for both tanks

	I don’t have to walk to get more gas.

	record keeping.

	instead of manually entering the information to save time in my busy life.

- As a user I would like there to be a way to switch between vehicles that I am driving. 

- As a user I would like the mpg to be as accurate as possible even when the app first loads
	therefore I have a baseline of my general cost.

	vehicle not a factory stat.

	so I feel as though the app is personal to me.

- As a user I want there to be a way to automatically update the amount of miles traveled, 
	therefore I don’t have to always enter the miles or if my odo doesn’t work.

- As a user I would like there to be a way to correct if the automatic mileage entry is wrong,
	so the mpg is not wrong.
	
- As a user I would like there to be a check if the auto entry of the gas pump info is wrong

- As a user I would like there to be a way to manually add the information from the pump if I 
	don’t want to use the auto feature or if the info is wrong

 	deleted if I request it
